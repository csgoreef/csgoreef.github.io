					Welcome

				<div class="text">
					Thank you for stopping by! We are embarking in one of the most enticing projects ever created for the csgo community. We believe that people with skill should also get the chance to be the owner of some sweet skins, despite the size of their wallet. To approach this we created “Csgo Reef”. Csgo reef is a tournament where 480 people get divided into 96 teams of 5 people. These teams compete against each other in a bracket style based tournament (The teams can be selected at random or at will based on the player’s choice). Once only one team is left they will be put into the finals, and the person to emerge from the finals will win the ultimate prize.

					How to enter
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					To enter this tournament, join the discord below and an automated bot will take you through the process. The discord bot will ask you to deposit one csgo case key (The entry fee) to add you to the system. Once that process is done, you will be asked to input your native language so we put you in a team with your native language. As of now we support 3 languages: English, Spanish and French. Once you select your language, you will be given the choice to be added to a random team or join an existing team (To allow you to play alongside your friends). You will then be given the perms to chat in general and we will dm you a private discord for your team where you guys can chat and get to know each other.

					Sales and refunds
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					After your initial purchase we can offer you a refund if requested until the tournament begins. After the tournament begins we are unable to provide refunds.  Refunds are processed by our sales team on discord and email: csgoreef@gmail.com . If using the email format, you will be asked to provide your discord id and your tradelink. If the team you are participating in falls apart you will be moved to another team of the same language. If the tournament is unable to reach the 480 people within the ceartin time period provided by our staff, you will be refunded your csgo key.
